## Secret spaces 

Mapping the New World was often shrouded in secrecy due to the competitive nature of ‘discovering’ and claiming new territories between the various empires. Details of new and opportune territories often remained undisclosed. Many early maps of North America, for example, reveal substantial empty spaces in the North-Eastern areas.  

This also had a significant effect on the representation of Native American tribes. Unlike the more familiar, detailed maps of Europe, maps of the American colonies often excluded Native American details, histories, names, and features.  

See, for example how these areas, depicted on H. Terrason’s Map of the North America in 1720 and the 1756 map of The British and French Dominions in North America held by Yale University Library, are lacking in local topographical, cultural and historical detail:

A similar lacunae is evident in de Wit’s map of America.  

- What do these maps reveal about the process claiming land?  
- Are ‘French’ territories marked differently to ‘British’ lands? 
- What features, or evidence do the maps provide to substantiate any claims to the land?  

## Claiming territories through artistic and narrative devices 

Imperial maps sometimes displayed English coats of arms, English ships, and Anglicised place names to implement British sovereignty and strength in new lands.  

Descriptive narratives can often be seen via cartouches on the borders of maps to further display strength to an international audience.
