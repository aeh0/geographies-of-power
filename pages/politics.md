## What is the significance of a map?  

In order to understand a map’s function in the world we must consider the following: 
- When and why was the map made? How was the map made? Who was the map created for? And who created the map?  
- Why do these questions matter?  

Widely used to navigate and identify large parts of the world by displaying geographical concepts, maps often reveal hidden historical agendas. Maps were used to survey and lay claim to new lands. Historians can view maps as social constructions of the world through the eyes of Empires, countries, and individuals. A particular discourse is evident in every map, and by asking these questions and uncovering the history of the creation of the map, their concealed agendas become more evident.  

## When viewing these different examples of maps, think about: 

- How do these maps differ?  
- Why were certain features added or excluded? 
- How useful were these maps to lower class members of society? 
- How could these act as historical sources?

## Cartographers: the significance of a map's creator

Power and knowledge were integral in early modern map-making. In an era of early empire and discovery, a deliberate policy of censorship was enforced. Cartography often emulated the abstract ideas of the British Monarchy. In this sense, cartographers always upheld a political agenda.  Many students followed their teacher’s mapmaking styles. Early modern maps therefore, often display common imperial ideas that persisted for many years.  

Thomas Kitchin, Lewis Evans, and Emmanuel Bowen were some of Britain’s key cartographers in the eighteenth-century. 

The development of print also complicated matters. Printed maps could also serve as decorative features and sometimes reveal revised details that were not approved by the author or were informed by outside forces. Lewis Evans’s map of the middle British colonies in North America  examples, for example, was subject to plagiarism and manipulation. 

Cartographers were paramount to the construction of maps, and their structural training in cartography was often evident in their work. Cartobibliography – the history or description of printed maps, can thus reveal contemporary ideas about land and ownership, as well as changes to borders through expansion, and visions of ‘new lands’ in the age of empire.  

For example, compare Lewis Evans’s map of the North American British Colonies with Thomas Kitchin’s. Can you identify any similarities or differences in their style, or geographical features?
