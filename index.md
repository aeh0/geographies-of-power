This resource highlights the potential of maps as imperial tools and historical sources. It is the result of a research project, supported and funded by Cardiff University Research Opportunities Programme, that examines how people on either side of the Atlantic crafted and contested borders on land and water.  

There is little known about how Welsh travellers to the Americas, and people exploring Wales, understood and wrote about borders in these regions. This guide emphasises the various ways in which maps, atlases, and Welsh writings on map-making and travel, can be used as key sources into historical concepts and representations on borders and power.  

Focusing on key themes, this resource will help you understand the importance of borders, symbols, and notions of representation on maps and other travel writings. The resource uses [IIIF](https://iiif.io) to examine the unique collection of early modern atlases and topographical materials held at Cardiff Universityâ€™s [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/special-collections), alongside maps held in American libraries, in answering these key questions: 

- What is a map? 
- How can maps be used as historical sources? 
- How do you read a map? 
- Why do borders matter?
